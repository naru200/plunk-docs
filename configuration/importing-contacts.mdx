Plunk does not provide a way to import contacts directly from a file. However, you can use the [Plunk API](/api-reference/contacts/create) to create contacts programmatically.

## Importing contacts with Python
If you have a list of contacts in a CSV file and are comfortable with Python, you can use the following script to import them into Plunk.

```python
import csv
import requests
from time import sleep

EMAIL_INDEX = 0
FILE_NAME = 'data.csv'
DELIMITER = ','

with open(FILE_NAME, 'r', errors='ignore') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=DELIMITER)

    for line in csv_reader:
        if len(line) == 0:
            continue

        retries = 3
        success = False
        while retries > 0 and not success:
            try:
                response = requests.post('https://api.useplunk.com/v1/contacts', json={
                    'email': line[EMAIL_INDEX].strip(),
                    'subscribed': True,
                }, headers={
                    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR SECRET KEY'
                })
                response.raise_for_status()
                print(response.json())
                success = True
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                print(f"Request failed: {e}")
                retries -= 1
                if retries > 0:
                    sleep(1)
                else:
                    print("Failed after 3 retries, continuing to next line.")
```
