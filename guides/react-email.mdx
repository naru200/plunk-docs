[React Email](https://react.email) took the React community by storm. It's a great way to build transactional email templates with React.
It is fully compatible with Plunk, and works out of the box. In this guide, we'll show you how to get started with React Email and Plunk.

# Transactional emails
When using Plunk's [transactional email API](/api-reference/transactional), you can use React Email to build your email templates directly in your code.
## Install dependencies
You can use the Plunk Node.js SDK. Install it with your favorite package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```sh npm
npm i @plunk/node @react-email/render
```
```sh yarn
yarn add @plunk/node @react-email/render
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create a component
Use React Email to create a reusable component. You can find a ton of examples on the [React Email website](https://react.email/examples).

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Html } from '@react-email/html';
import { Button } from '@react-email/button';

export default function Email(props) {
  const { url } = props;

  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Button href={url}>Click me!</Button>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

## Convert and send it!
Now that you have a component, use the `render` function to convert it to HTML, and [send it with Plunk](/api-reference/transactional/send).

```ts
import Plunk from '@plunk/node';
import { render } from '@react-email/render';
import { Email } from './email';

const plunk = new Plunk("<API_KEY>");

const body = render(<Email url={"https://useplunk.com"} />);

const success = await plunk.emails.send({
    to: "hello@useplunk.com",
    subject: "Hello world!",
    body,
});
```

# Actions
Plunk [actions](/overview#actions) support React Email as well. You cannot use React Email directly, and will have to compile your React Email component to HTML first.

Once you have your HTML, you can paste it into the Plunk template editor and use it as a template for your actions.
