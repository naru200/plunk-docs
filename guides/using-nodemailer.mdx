[Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) is a popular Node.js module which allows you to easily send emails. In this guide, you'll learn how to set it up with Plunk's SMTP settings.

# Prerequisites
Before we begin, we'll need to install `nodemailer`, and store sensitive values inside a `.env` file.

## Install Nodemailer
<CodeGroup>
```sh npm
npm i nodemailer
```
```sh yarn
yarn add nodemailer
```
```sh pnpm
pnpm add nodemailer
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Nodemailer types (Optional)

If you're using TypeScript in your project, make sure to download `@types/nodemailer` as well:
<CodeGroup>
```sh npm
npm i @types/nodemailer --save-dev
```
```sh yarn
yarn add -D @types/nodemailer
```
```sh pnpm
pnpm add -D @types/nodemailer
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup environment varaibles

It is best practise to store sensitive values inside an `.env` file, add the following values to your env file:
```sh .env
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-secret-api-key
```

# Sending Transactional emails
Now our project is setup, we can send transactional emails using Nodemailer. First, we need to setup the `transporter` which holds the connection information and decide what secure method to use:

## Using STARTTLS
To use STARTTLS, set your port to `587` and set `secure` to false:

```js
const transporter = createTransport({
	host: "smtp.useplunk.com",
	secure: false,
	port: 587,
	auth: {
		user: "plunk",
		pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD
	}
});
```

## Using SSL
To use SSL, set your port to `465` and set `secure` to true:

```js
const transporter = createTransport({
	host: "smtp.useplunk.com",
	secure: true,
	port: 465,
	auth: {
		user: "plunk",
		pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD
	}
});
```

## Sending mail!
Now that the `transporter` has been initalised, we can send some mail!

```js
const info = await transporter.sendMail({
	from: "hello@example.com",
	to: "hello@example.com",
	subject: "Plunk is awesome!",
	html: "Check it out at https://useplunk.com"
});

await transporter.sendMail(info).catch((err) => {
	console.error(err);
});
```
