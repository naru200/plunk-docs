Transactional emails are most often a one-to-one communication between your application and your users. They are triggered by a user action, such as a password reset or a purchase confirmation.

## Prerequisites
- A Plunk account
- A secret key from the Plunk dashboard

## Sending an email
Sending a transactional email only requires a single API call with 3 parameters: `to`, `subject`, and `body`.

- `to`: A single email address or an array of email addresses.
- `subject`: The subject of the email.
- `body`: The body of the email. This can be plain text or HTML.

```javascript
await fetch('https://api.useplunk.com/v1/send', {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        "to": "hello@useplunk.com",
        "subject": "Hello world!",
        "body": "Your first email with Plunk"
    })
});
```
